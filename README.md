Cyber Surf is a VR flying game where the player races to discover new worlds or race against the computer.

An assortment of different Cyber Surf boards are available to choose from, each with their own individual handling.

Modes can be tailored to fit the competitive nature of each individual player, ranging from Time Trial to Exploration.

Ditch your gamepad controller and use the custom-built surfboard controller to reach a whole new level of immersion.

Thing of interest (things I am particularly proud of creating):


Graphics effects made using custom shaders in Unity,
such as a boundary box that fades in the closer you get to it,

I also created the entire scoring system inside of the game, along with various other smaller things, such as parts of the screen changing, camera system interacting with the VR headsets, ect.
